Sample programs from my work in the following fields:

At the University of North Carolina Coastal Studies Institute, I have analyzed 16 months of hydrophone data, automatically detecting and classifying marine mammal vocalizations, correlating the vocalizations to oceanographic features, and looking for trends and patterns in the data. I have used a combination of off-the-shelf tools and my own custom code (in matlab and R). 

At the Ocean Biology Processing Group at NASA Goddard, I worked on satellite data processing, developing the code to transform the raw satellite data into an image.
