Sample programs in matlab, R, and C++ from my work in acoustic signal processing, marine science, and remote sensing:

At the University of North Carolina Coastal Studies Institute, I have analyzed 16 months of hydrophone data, automatically detecting and classifying marine mammal vocalizations, correlating the vocalizations to oceanographic features, and looking for trends and patterns in the data. I have used a combination of off-the-shelf tools and my own custom code (in matlab and R).

At the University of North Carolina Division of Speech and Hearing, I developed matlab code to run experiments in audiology.

At the Ocean Biology Processing Group at NASA Goddard, I worked on satellite data processing, developing the C/C++ code to calibrate the raw satellite data and transform it into an image.
